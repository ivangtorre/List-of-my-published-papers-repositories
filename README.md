# Introduction
I do endorse the recommendations about the reproducibility and replicability of scientific results. Therefore, I try to share with the community all the preprocessing, training, inference, statistical analysis and figure plot scripts I developed during a scientific publication. This is not only an exercise in transparency but also aims to establish collaboration frameworks with other researchers.

Due to privacy restrictions imposed by the data used or the place where the research has been carried out, not in all cases can I share all the data publicly. However, if you are interested in discussing any procedure of an unshared scientific publication repository, do not hesitate to contact me.
For an updated complete list of my scientific publications, you can visit my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=DPBM9NMAAAAJ&hl) profile or my [personal website](https://www.ivangtorre.com).
